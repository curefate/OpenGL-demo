# Overview
An OpenGL demo which implements light rendering, model import, skeleton animation, collision, camera control, etc. I built this project with the game engine as target.
<br>You can find a video showing the result of this project in `/video/demo.mp4`.

***
## Rendering & Animation
Shaders and codes of mesh, light, anim are followed the guide of this [tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/).

## Library & Resources
To run the source code, you need:
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- [Resources(models, animations, textures...)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18RRSnVsOj05GRBE_dkPKxL02JkJ-TxeA?usp=sharing)
<br>All resources are free on internet, most of them are from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).

And run Test.cpp then.

## Release file
Can be download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fDpgYux7spfUZlJNzqTC1I2flfelW8lA?usp=sharing).

## Others
Sound related functions have not yet been implemented, so the `voice.h` is useless now.
